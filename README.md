# Conways-Game-of-Life
Written as an exercise in Python, basically my first project.
Everything that a user needs to know is in the Instructions menu in the app.
The project lacks some basic functions, that are meant to be developed later on, if available:
- updating the table widget every generation, not only for the last one
- adjusting window size to table size
